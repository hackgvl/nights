## Tasks (In-advance)
- [ ] Review the [HG Nights talk submissions spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jOvH-iBS9c84flUriNKxrvy25KTS8FnhHuto4PkaXt4/edit?gid=359534720#gid=359534720).  If there are more speakers than slots, then a suggested order of offering is:
  - [ ] First-time speakers with an official submission
  - [ ] Unofficial submissions (ideas gathered from Slack conversations) for first-time speakers
  - [ ] Official submissions from prior speakers
  - [ ] Unofficial submissions from prior speakers
  - [ ] If a tie-breaker is needed, then consult the "Topics of Interest" collected from the prior event RSVPs
  - [ ] If multiple talks are on the same / overlapping topic, then consider an overlapping talk at a future event.
- [ ] If more talk submissions are still needed:
  - [ ] Reach out to speakers who have previously expressed interest, but haven't submitted a talk, and invite them to fill out the [Talk Submission form](https://forms.gle/gudqeQwpjQmR7QLV6)
  - [ ] Post a call for speaker / talk submissions in #community-organizers directing people to fill out the [Talk Submission form](https://forms.gle/gudqeQwpjQmR7QLV6)
  - [ ] Post a call for speaker / talk submissions in #general or #random a week or so after posting in #community-organizers
  - [ ] Offer lightning talks to organizers of groups which are on hiatus or which have low attendance
  - [ ] Ask community partners to promote the call for speakers to their relevant audience
- [ ] Have a backup speaker for when someone is sick or can’t make it.
- [ ] Advise speakers to come with proper video adapters to connect their laptop via HDMI
- [ ] TODO Consider grading the talks on skill / knowledge level: newbie, intermediate, advanced and having a mix of different levels
- [ ] (Jim has a template) Connect with speakers over Slack to share details (audio / video setup, share Wi-Fi details, time slots, attendee expectations (like expecting people to come and go during the talks), video recording, [where to park and how to enter the building](https://joinopenworks.com/guest-access)
- [ ] Ask if speakers need any special equipment, like power cords, whiteboards & markers, podium, audio speakers, time clocks, projector
- [ ] Suggest that speakers come early to test Wi-Fi, video, and other connections
- [ ] Remind speakers to repeat any questions if they have a Q&A so the questions can be heard on the video recording
- [ ] One or two days before the event, reach out to the sponsor with notes about their 2-3 minute toast. See "[HG Nights - Sponsor Communications Examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WKbh_MVxDDwmUQ4HLQNd6CKACxq34Icwhnyp0mgEyUE/)" for an example.
