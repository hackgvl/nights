  - [ ] Unofficial submissions (ideas gathered from Slack conversations) for first-time speakers
  - [ ] Official submissions from prior speakers
  - [ ] Unofficial submissions from prior speakers

- [ ] If more talk submissions are still needed:
  - [ ] Reach out to speakers who have previously expressed interest, but haven't submitted a talk, and invite them to fill out the [Talk Submission form](https://forms.gle/gudqeQwpjQmR7QLV6)
  - [ ] Post a call for speaker / talk submissions in #community-organizers directing people to fill out the [Talk Submission form](https://forms.gle/gudqeQwpjQmR7QLV6)
  - [ ] Post a call for speaker / talk submissions in #general or #random a week or so after posting in #community-organizers

- [ ] Have a backup speaker for when someone is sick or can’t make it.
- [ ] Advise speakers to come with proper video adapters to connect their laptop via HDMI
- [ ] TODO Consider grading the talks on skill / knowledge level: newbie, intermediate, advanced and having a mix of different levels
- [ ] (Jim has a template) Connect with speakers over Slack to share details (audio / video setup, share Wi-Fi details, time slots, attendee expectations (like expecting people to come and go during the talks), video recording, [where to park and how to enter the building](https://joinopenworks.com/guest-access)
