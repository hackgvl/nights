See our earlier [Food & Drink Planning](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues?q=food+planning+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue) issues for past notes and context.

### Notes
- The [SnackGreenville document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBEl61eH4kB6NVHqjrlEgnYyRrfONAyJoQXFcH5muaQ/edit#heading=h.374owrq3m4r2) has recent history, including the prices and amounts used for the HG Nights pilot taco bar.
- For estimating, see our [past Event Attendance, Cancel, No Show, Walk-in, Food Eaten count and ratios doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ddyknPjweYzK-vJ2YWujshVpZGJWo9UVzfldlg8usmc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- At a past event we had 5 out of 75 attendees indicate a dietary allergy / constraint, including: peanut, pecan, dairy, vegan, and vegetarian concerns. This confirms we should avoid some ingredients, or else have at least one option which will satisfy these types of concerns.

### Food Volunteers
- Confirmed:
- Unconfirmed / Past: see the [past volunteer](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues?q=volunteers+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue) threads for more details

### Hot Plates,  Slow Cookers, Griddle
If we need these to keep things warm, then people offered.
- @allella - 21" x 11" griddle
- @allella - convection oven
- @sirbeep - dual hot plate
- @ThorntonMatthewD - has a couple of slow cookers and a hot plate

### Budget
- Volunteers making food will have a set amount per batch based on the assumed number of guests they will be feeding
- Catering and recipes can typically be cut by 25-40%, as noted in the _SnackGreenville_ document (link above)
- Earlier events have range from 55 to 75 people and not everyone will eat
- Volunteers will be reimbursed by RefactorGVL by check as part of the [Post-Event Tasks and Wrap-up](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues?q=wrap-up+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

### Other Food and Desserts
- Toppings
- We have previously done an ice cream sandwich handout about 15-20 minutes before the wrap-up, which requires a freezer at the host location, and about half of the remaining guests tend to partake.
- Beer - Given the liability and added cost, this could remain a volunteer-only perk

### Drinks
- Canned drinks seem to work best and can be recycled at OpenWorks
- Refrigerating the drinks in advance and setting them out in the retail boxes on top of something to absorb condensation seems to work well
- Sparkling Water
- Soda
- Bottled water - we typically provide cups and ice if there's tap water nearby, as there is at OpenWorks

### Tasks (In-advance)
- [ ] Put out a call for volunteers
- [ ] Dietary or allergy considerations - check to registration form responses
- [ ] Instruct volunteers to save any receipts for reimbursement
- [ ] Gather recipe ingredients so they can be printed on signs for allergy considerations
- [ ] Pay for any prepared food from vendors, either in advance, or at pickup. 
- [ ] Check the vendor's hours of operation and pick-up details in advance
- [ ] Communicate with volunteers
- [ ] Designate a reliable pick-up person and share the pick-up time and details of how to unload the food at the venue
- [ ] Determine if drinks can be refrigerated in advance, or if ice and ice bins are needed. - Jim has some 6" tall plastic totes which we've used in the past to ice drinks, and they could be used upon request.
- [ ] Determine if any prepared food needs to be refrigerated and confirm there is space - OpenWorks has a large and small refrigerator and there is typically space as long as the refrigerators have been cleaned out of old stuff
- [ ] Determine if a freezer is needed and available at the venue. - OpenWorks has a very small freezer, so we'd definitely need to verify space in advance.
- [ ] Determine if any convection ovens, hot plates, or insulating pads / coolers are need to keep food warm

- [ ] Purchase any food, drinks, plates, napkins, etc in advance
- [ ] Purchase volunteer beer and any special volunteer snacks.  A 15 mix pack. like Oskar Blues, is usually enough.
