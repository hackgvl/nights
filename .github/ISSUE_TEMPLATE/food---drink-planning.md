See our earlier [Food & Drink Planning](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues?q=food+planning+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue) issues for past notes and context.

### Notes
- The [SnackGreenville document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBEl61eH4kB6NVHqjrlEgnYyRrfONAyJoQXFcH5muaQ/edit#heading=h.374owrq3m4r2) has recent history, including the prices and amounts used for the HG Nights pilot taco bar.
- For estimating, see our [past Event Attendance, Cancel, No Show, Walk-in, Food Eaten count and ratios doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ddyknPjweYzK-vJ2YWujshVpZGJWo9UVzfldlg8usmc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- At a past event we had 5 out of 75 attendees indicate a dietary allergy / constraint, including: peanut, pecan, dairy, vegan, and vegetarian concerns. This confirms we should avoid some ingredients, or else have at least one option which will satisfy these types of concerns.

### Hot Plates,  Slow Cookers, Griddle
If we need these to keep things warm, then people offered.
- @allella - 21" x 11" griddle
- @allella - convection oven
- @sirbeep - dual hot plate
- @ThorntonMatthewD - has a couple of slow cookers and a hot plate

### Budget
- Volunteers making food will have a set amount per batch based on the assumed number of guests they will be feeding
- Catering and recipes can typically be cut by 25-40%, as noted in the _SnackGreenville_ document (link above)
- Earlier events have range from 55 to 75 people and not everyone will eat
- Volunteers will be reimbursed by RefactorGVL by check as part of the [Post-Event Tasks and Wrap-up](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues?q=wrap-up+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).

### Other Food and Desserts
- Toppings
- We have previously done an ice cream sandwich handout about 15-20 minutes before the wrap-up, which requires a freezer at the host location, and about half of the remaining guests tend to partake.
- Beer - Given the liability and added cost, this could remain a volunteer-only perk

### Drinks
- Canned drinks seem to work best and can be recycled at OpenWorks
- Refrigerating the drinks in advance and setting them out in the retail boxes on top of something to absorb condensation seems to work well
- Sparkling Water
- Soda
- Bottled water - we typically provide cups and ice if there's tap water nearby, as there is at OpenWorks

### Tasks (In-advance)
- [ ] Put out a call for volunteers
- [ ] Dietary or allergy considerations - check to registration form responses
- [ ] Instruct volunteers to save any receipts for reimbursement
- [ ] Gather recipe ingredients so they can be printed on signs for allergy considerations
- [ ] Pay for any prepared food from vendors, either in advance, or at pickup. 
- [ ] Check the vendor's hours of operation and pick-up details in advance
- [ ] Communicate with volunteers
- [ ] Designate a reliable pick-up person and share the pick-up time and details of how to unload the food at the venue
- [ ] Determine if drinks can be refrigerated in advance, or if ice and ice bins are needed. - Jim has some 6" tall plastic totes which we've used in the past to ice drinks, and they could be used upon request.
- [ ] Determine if any prepared food needs to be refrigerated and confirm there is space - OpenWorks has a large and small refrigerator and there is typically space as long as the refrigerators have been cleaned out of old stuff
- [ ] Determine if a freezer is needed and available at the venue. - OpenWorks has a very small freezer, so we'd definitely need to verify space in advance.
- [ ] Determine if any convection ovens, hot plates, or insulating pads / coolers are need to keep food warm

- [ ] Purchase any food, drinks, plates, napkins, etc in advance
- [ ] Purchase volunteer beer and any special volunteer snacks.  A 15 mix pack. like Oskar Blues, is usually enough. 

### Tasks (At the Event Venue)
- [ ] Prepare any food that’s being made on-site
- [ ] Setup food, serving bowls, serving utensils (spoons, tongs). Setup TWO serving utensils for EACH of the main dishes so people can serve from both sides of the bar.
- [ ] Setup bowls / plates at check-in table so people need to check-in before they can eat.
- [ ] Setup napkins, forks / spoons at the end of the food line / upper bar, so people don't have to hold these things while they are making a plate
- [ ] Put forks or spoons in a container, like a mason jar, or small bowl, with the handles facing up / out so people can grab them by the handle.
- [ ] Avoid putting any very hot items directly on the wood counter tops. Use a trivet or other something under hot items. 
- [ ] Move the trash and recycling cans out of the way, but still in a visible spot.
- [ ] Setup a bus bucket and tape sign **(not on drywall)** near the trash cans for dirty utensils / dishes
- [ ] Setup any food heating (ovens, crockpots, hot plates, microwave) or chilling equipment using heavy power cords if needed and try to not put everything on the same circuit, if / when it's possible to tell.
- [ ] Setup drinks, ice, cups on a rolling table near the check-in
  - Cans
    1. [ ] Setup cans - Ideally, keep cans in the cardboard boxes and open 1/2 of one end of the box and put something under the rear of the box so the cans roll forward to the opening for easy grabbing.
    1. [ ] Otherwise, if cans are not cold then it may not be necessary to ice them down in a bin.
    - Note: If icing down the cans, put cans into any bins before pouring the ice on top. Otherwise, it’s very hard to put the cans into shallow ice.
    - Note: Icing cans will often cause condensation, so putting a towel or thick piece of cardboard under the cold bin can help insulate the bottom and limit a wet mess
  - [ ] If using 2-liters, then setup the bottles and cups - (Note: OpenWorks has a bunch of small foam cups in the lower cabinets opposite the bar stools)
  - [ ] (Optionally) Setup clean ice bucket w/ drinking ice & tongs - ideally this isn't needed when serving refrigerated cans
- [ ] When the line forms, encourage people to use both sides of the bar to double the throughput of the main course.
