## Check-in / Guests
- [ ] Gather tape needed for signs
- [ ] Gather extra name tag sheets (use the "removable" type as the regular Avery-style tags can fall off)
- [ ] Gather extra paper, pen, and black marker for walk-in guests to write on their name tags

## Name Tags
- [ ] Print and gather name tags using the [existing templates on the Avery site](https://www.avery.com/myaccount/projects).
  - [ ] Use Avery compatible / style 5395 or 25395 name tags
- [ ] Export a guest list from Meetup by clicking "Organizer Tools > Manage Attendees” from the event page. Then, select “Manage Attendees > Attendee Details" to download a spreadsheet. Requires "Organizer" role on Meetup.com, but this works even without a "Pro" account.  
  - [ ] Copy the attendees names from the Meetup export to the [_TEMPLATE - HG Nights Name Tag Attendee List Curated with Recognition_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14N1BP9ien56pc9Q3LjxuNqPUEQj08zWKnB38GR7vyLc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) on Google Drive and add any recognition columns (speaker, sponsor, volunteer, organizer, committee, board)
  - [ ] Export a CSV from the curated attendee list and import it into the Avery site, overwriting any existing mail merge data and use the "Import Data > Replace Spreadsheet" in the left side bar of the Avery site to overwrite the existing data.
  - [ ] The "Arrange Fields" forces you to add a field. Add the "Name" field, which will duplicate it on the preview.  Click on the smaller "Name" field and then click the delete icon.
  - [ ] Export to the name tags to PDF and print. Note the print time on the sheet so the check-in table knows what time we cut off.

## Signage
  - [ ] Print signage for food with the recipe name, creator's name and ingredients
  - [ ] Entrance signs - lobby entrance direction for late guests
  - [ ] Guest Wi-Fi
  - [ ] Directional pointing to restrooms
  - [ ] Conference room numbers
  - [ ] Computer and/or USB Drive with the digital file showing the schedule and sponsors for display on the promo TV in the kitchen
  - [ ] Gather "neon" signs - Olivia created plug-in small neon color signs for HG Labs, HG Nights, and HackGreenville - These are plug-in and operated with the corresponding remotes. These are stored at OpenWorks. They do work on batteries, but none are currently in them.

## Speakers / Presenters
- [ ] Print three copies (organizer, timekeeper, video crew) of the final [TEMPLATE-hackgreenville-nights-schedule-and-talking-points-for-organizer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8uEepEqRVLBF-wuD_tkLjXNyFA4WHK_5apciJEXfwM/edit?tab=t.0)
- [ ] Gather any audio, video cables, whiteboards, dry erase markers, erasers, podiums, time clocks, or video adapters that may be needed

## Food & Drinks
- [ ] Water pitcher with ice & reusable cups for a water station
- [ ] Extension cords and power strips. Be sure the amperage and outlet distribution are sufficient for the load for any higher load appliances (ovens, crockpots, hot plates, microwave)
- [ ] Sanitize, knives, cutting boards, can openers, food processors, and other food preparing tools as needed
- [ ] Serving bowls, utensils, spoon rests for messy spoons

- [ ] Gather clean / drinking ice bucket and tongs for serving beverage ice 
- [ ] Buy groceries, beverages, consumables, aluminum foil, etc
- [ ] Prepare any food that needs to be made in advance
- [ ] Pickup food that being prepared by a third-party
- [ ] Mason jars, or similar container, for storing forks, spoons, knives
- [ ] Trivets or something to put under any very hot items that might come in contact with the wood counter tops
- [ ] Towel(s) to put under any ice bins
- [ ] Bag clips
