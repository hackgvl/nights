## General Tasks
- [ ] Confirm the event date, time, and venue reservation
- [ ] Logo - Pam and Olivia created neon logo concepts. Jim has those files saved.
- [ ] When referencing the sponsor (Slack, Meetup, etc), include a hyperlink to their homepage.  This will help viewers and [avoid linking to a specific product or service](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/administration-and-financial-management/tax-treatment-income-received-corporate).
- [ ] [Add date and speakers to HG Nights website page](https://hackgreenville.com/hg-nights).
- [ ] (Pam) _HG Nights_ themed Graphic with the schedule, sponsor logos / recognition, for large TV
- [ ] When speakers and food are confirmed, usually weeks in advance, send an update to those RSVPed by either:
  - Meetup allows up to 700 characters to send a "Comment" on the event.
  - From the event page, the "Organizers Tools > Contact Attendees" can be used to message only those who have RSVPed 'Yes'.
- [ ] Announce in the #events Slack channel
- [ ] Announce on OpenWorksâ€™ Basecamp
(https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/search/?q=what%27s+happening+in+greenville&t=week).
- [ ] Share via on other community boards / mailing lists - Synergy Mill, Beer & Napkins, StartUpGVL Slack, any other Meetup groups?
- [ ] Ask Build Carolina (Lauren McGlamery) to promote to their audience
- [ ] Coordinate with the volunteer who is taking photos at the event for use in future promotions for HG Nights and other HG things.
- [ ] Invite local writers / journalists to attend and cover the event
- [ ] Considering mentioning any upcoming conferences
- [ ] Swag - HackGreenville and/or Sponsor swag table

## Social Media
- [ ] See the [_HG Nights_ Social Media Posting Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FpgtQziEI5_3TLiRE_zjC6gzXCZ7on9DEYShtvu2UKw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.imsv5n75gdbc) for tips and warnings about the platforms we use.
- [ ] Share on social media accounts.
- [ ] Have organizers share on their own social media accounts
- [ ] With the warnings below in mind, consider if it's worth announcing HG Nights on the local /r/greenville Reddit
  - Jim's account was suspended by Reddit, not the local sub-Reddit, with no explanation. It's unclear if using the word "hack", along with including the speaker's names, made the algorithm flag it.
  - Do NOT post a standalone post (which they may flag). Post as a comment to [the latest "What's Happening in Greenville?" post]

## Meetup / Event Platform Post
- [ ] Create and promote on the [existing Meetup.com account](https://www.meetup.com/hack-greenville/)
  - [ ] Add themed banner / hero image and sponsor logo - see the [pilot event for an example](https://www.meetup.com/hack-greenville/events/296051672/)
  - [ ] Add a text AND link to the sponsor's website in the event post
  - [ ] Confirm any link to a sponsor is [ONLY to their homepage and not to a page for a specific product or service](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/administration-and-financial-management/tax-treatment-income-received-corporate)
  - [ ] Meetup only allows 1 question to be added to each event. We are currently collecting Topics of interests, but consider using this field to also collect the name of any guests, so we can print a name tag for guests.
  - [ ] Add RefactorGVL text link to the bottom of the event description.
  - [ ] Food menu
  - [ ] Schedule
- [ ] Publish the Meetup listing and approve the announcement
- [ ] A day or so before the event, send a follow-up announcement to those who registered using the _TEMPLATE-hackgreenville-nights-meetup-message-to-attendees_ [template on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17wq1n9VCUMTiyZSKHL61mW6Xte5DKWjb). On the event page, use the "Organizers Tools > Contact Attendees" feature to message only those who have RSVPed 'Yes'
  - [ ] Directions
  - [ ] Parking and parking deck fees
  - [ ]  Entrances / Doorbell - for OpenWorks we know have a guest access page, which could be shared in the Meetup listing and as a reminder a day or two before the event.
  - [ ] Any street closures due to festivals, events at The Well, or downtown construction
  - [ ] Expectations for coming and going from rooms and social area
  - [ ] Accessibility - confirm handicap accessible parking and access to the building
