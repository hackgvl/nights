# HackGreenville Nights

## Overview

_HG Nights_ is a "quarterly-ish" in-person social gathering of our local tech and tech-adjacent workforce and organizers that helps create and reinforce community connections.

Our [_HG Nights_ page](https://hackgreenville.com/hg-nights) provides more details on past speakers, sponsors, talk submission form, and videos of the talks.

The event aims to:
* bridge the time gaps between our in-person monthly meetups and annual conferences.
* give HG members an opportunity to share a short tech or tech-adjacent talk (5, 10, or 15 minutes).
* get [_HackGreenville Slack_](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack) members out of the machine and to face-to-face conversations with people they might otherwise only know as a profile picture or username.

## Volunteering

All _HG Nights_ events are volunteer-run and we use this GitHub as a project management tool.

New volunteers can connect via the _#community-organizers_ channel in [_HG Slack_](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack).

## Planning

* Planning usually starts 60 to 45 days before the expected event date.
* The event date is often selected to give us 45 days to organize our volunteers.
* For each event, we start by populating our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/issues) from [issue templates](https://github.com/hackgvl/nights/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
* We also chit-chat in the [_HG Slack_](https://hackgreenville.com/join-slack) for quick conversations that don't benefit from being saved publically in a corresponding GitHub issue.
* We use a [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/hackgvl/projects/6) as a visualization of the aforementioned issues. The roadmap is simialar to a Gantt chart and includes assignees and estimates of start dates and due dates for broader issues.
* Each issue includes tasks that can be checked off.
* In a few cases, we include links to external documents when the nature of the tasks or process benefit from privacy or extra details that aren't easily convenved within GitHub conventions. 

The event has typically happened 3 times a year
* **Winter** - mid-to-late February
* **Spring** - late May
* **Fall** - late October

We purposely avoid overlapping with the end-of-year holiday season and our [local tech conference](https://hackgreenville.com/orgs).
